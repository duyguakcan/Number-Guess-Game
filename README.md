# Number-Guess-Game
Against computer AI number guess game. Also known as "Mastermind" but with numbers.

## There are 2 parts of the game:

1- Computer guesses the number in your mind

2- You guess the number in computer's mind (or cpu)

## Rules:

1- The number in mind should be 4 digit and each digit should be different than the others.

2- When a person guesses number the rival says how many positive and how many negative the guess has

  a- Positive number means there are that much digits are placed at right place
  
  b- Negative number means there are that much digits exist but the placement is wrong.
  
  ###### Example: 
  
  Number in mind => 1234
  
  Guess => 1240
  
  Result => +2 (because 2 digits at right place), -1 (because 1 digit which is '4' exists but at wrong place)
  
3- If a person guesses right, then it is win condition.
